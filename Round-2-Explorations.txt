I want you ropinion on some stuff

My project has turned into being a critique about our current ethos aorund designing technology, how companies emphasise productivity, no downtime, notifications, and how the measure success with time spent on the site, number of people subscribed to their newsletter etc


So i have a few ideas for small projects to explore and I wanted your opinion and oyu have to give it because your using my uni resources. So like if these are worth trying or need to be changed


First one is a lazy robot, basically it would be a little robot in a space designed to deliver messages from one end of the table to another. except it has a  little phone in its hands, and when you ask it to deliver the message sometimes it just ignores you and looks at its phone or sighs and does it slowly etc.


Second is like a terminal set up, with a very fun/cute looking website that says make an account to get started. And then it takes that account info and starts trying to log into your google accounts, youtube, facebook, insta, spotify, etc. Then it would return a list saying "wow! i have access to your xyz accounts now! thanks/how fun!" and then just resets

Next is a smart chair that forces you to relax for 5 minutes. Bsically just a lounge chair with a clip like on a treadmill, and it will keep trying to get your to "relax", saying stuff like "OUR EMPLOYEE DATA INDICATES EMPLOYEES WHO UNDERTTAKE A SHORT RESTING PROCESS ARE MORE PRODUCTIVE. YOU MUST REST NOW." And it would get angry if you unclip and try to leave before 5 mins or whatever is up

Last current idea I have that i think is good is a big black box with a place to put your hand to be scanned. And then it would maybe have some facial recognition or something and try and get as much info as possible about you from basically just this, and rpesent it to the person, but without telling them how it does it.
